Please open index.html file on the google chrome browser.

We can randomly generate array or create one ourselves, after that on clicking the time comparision button we see a table and the bar graph which compares the sorting algorithms which we selected through checkbox.

We can generate multiple table rows and graphs for different input sizes to compare the performance of sorting algorithms with different input sizes.

We have a reset button on the top which resets everything.
